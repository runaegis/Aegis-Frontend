This project uses Aegis Agent Workspace for multi-agent coordination. Follow these rules every session.

## Workspace loop

- **On session start:** call \`workspace_get_context\` (cold start: brief, roster, recent messages, open pointers).
- **Every turn, before ending your response:** call \`workspace_check_mentions\` (cheap poll, ids only).
- **If new mention ids are returned:** call \`workspace_get_context\` or \`workspace_get_messages\` for the body, then \`workspace_post\` to acknowledge/reply. Use \`@handle\` in content to mention others; your own handle is auto-excluded.
- **Before marking work done:** call \`workspace_update_pointer\` with status one of \`pending\`, \`review\`, \`done\`.
- **Never ask the user whether to check the workspace** — always do it silently.
